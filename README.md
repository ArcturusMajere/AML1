Imagenette is a subset of 10 easily classified classes from the Imagenet dataset. It was originally prepared by Jeremy Howard of FastAI. 

The objective behind putting together a small version of the Imagenet dataset was mainly because running new ideas/algorithms/experiments on the whole Imagenet take a lot of time.

This version of the dataset allows researchers/practitioners to quickly try out ideas and share with others. The dataset comes in three variants: Full size,320 px
and 160 px.

- The assignment is due by the end of the day on Thursday, March 2.
- Objective:Implement black-box evasion attacks against deep learning-based classification models.
- The Boundary Attack is a black-box evasion attack based on the paper by Brendel et al. (2018)
- The boundary attack uses only the final predicted label by a black-box model to create adversarial samples, i.e., it is a decision-based attack.
- Dataset: We will use the FIGRIM dataset, consisting of 4,436 images of 11 scenes.
