# AML1
Spring 2023 CS 504 AML Project 1
- The assignment is due by the end of the day on Tuesday, February 14. 
- Objective: Implement common white-box evasion attacks against deep learning-based classification models. 
- Imagenette is a subset of 10 easily classified classes from the Imagenet dataset. 
- It was originally prepared by Jeremy Howard of FastAI.

 # AML2
 Spring 2023 CS 504 AML Project 2
- The assignment is due by the end of the day on Thursday, March 2.
- Objective:Implement black-box evasion attacks against deep learning-based classification models.
- The Boundary Attack is a black-box evasion attack based on the paper by Brendel et al. (2018)
- The boundary attack uses only the final predicted label by a black-box model to create adversarial samples, i.e., it is a decision-based attack.
- Dataset: We will use the FIGRIM dataset, consisting of 4,436 images of 11 scenes.
