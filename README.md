Imagenette is a subset of 10 easily classified classes from the Imagenet dataset. It was originally prepared by Jeremy Howard of FastAI. 

The objective behind putting together a small version of the Imagenet dataset was mainly because running new ideas/algorithms/experiments on the whole Imagenet take a lot of time.

This version of the dataset allows researchers/practitioners to quickly try out ideas and share with others. The dataset comes in three variants: Full size,320 px
and 160 px.

For now, i will use 160px.
 **use TF_VGG-R50_Imagenette.ipynb for this task**
